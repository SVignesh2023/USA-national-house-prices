# USA-national-house-prices
Create a model to find key factors that influence US home prices nationally, over a period of 20 years.

If you want to run the project, follow these steps:
1) Download all the files as it is. Preserve the files in the folders as it is.
2) Run the Consolidated.ipynb file first. This creates a merged dataset for our project. This dataset is called as 'housing_full.csv' and is created and placed in the Data folder.
3) Finally, run the main.ipynb file. Visualizations and model outputs in the python script itself.
4) Read the Report.pdf file for a full breakdown of the project.

Thank You!
